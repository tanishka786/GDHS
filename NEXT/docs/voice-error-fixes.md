# Voice Recognition Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "no-speech" Error Handling
**Problem**: The speech recognition API was throwing "no-speech" errors when no speech was detected, causing user-visible error messages.

**Solution**: 
- Added specific error handling for different speech recognition error types
- Made "no-speech" errors silent (no user-visible error message)
- Added user-friendly error messages for other error types

### 2. Automatic Restart in Voice Mode
**Problem**: When no speech was detected in voice mode, the system would stop listening permanently.

**Solution**:
- Added automatic restart mechanism with a 2-second delay
- Implemented restart counter to prevent infinite loops (max 3 restarts)
- Reset counter on successful recording start or mode toggle

### 3. Extension Context Invalidation
**Problem**: Browser extension context errors were causing crashes during cleanup.

**Solution**:
- Added try-catch blocks around cleanup operations
- Graceful error handling during component unmount
- Proper cleanup of speech recognition instances

## Code Changes Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
```typescript
recognition.onerror = (event: any) => {
  // Handle specific error types with user-friendly messages
  switch (event.error) {
    case 'no-speech':
      errorMessage = 'No speech detected. Please try speaking closer to the microphone.';
      break;
    case 'audio-capture':
      errorMessage = 'Microphone not accessible. Please check your microphone permissions.';
      break;
    // ... other cases
  }
  
  // Only show error for critical issues, not for no-speech
  if (event.error !== 'no-speech' && event.error !== 'aborted') {
    setError(errorMessage);
  }
};
```

### Auto-Restart Mechanism
```typescript
recognition.onend = () => {
  // In voice mode, automatically restart recording after a brief pause
  if (isVoiceMode && conversationActive && restartCountRef.current < maxRestarts) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (isVoiceMode && conversationActive && audioStatus === 'idle' && !isRecording) {
        startRecording();
      }
    }, 2000);
  }
};
```

### Restart Counter Management
- Added `restartCountRef` to track automatic restarts
- Reset counter on successful recording start
- Reset counter when toggling voice mode
- Maximum of 3 automatic restarts before showing error

### Improved Cleanup
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    try {
      // Safe cleanup with error handling
      if (streamRef.current) {
        streamRef.current.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
      }
      // ... other cleanup
    } catch (error) {
      // Ignore cleanup errors to prevent extension context issues
    }
  };
}, []);
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: No more confusing "no-speech" error messages
2. **Continuous Voice Mode**: Automatic restart keeps voice mode active
3. **Stability**: Prevents infinite restart loops and handles cleanup gracefully
4. **Error Prevention**: Reduces browser extension context errors

## Testing

The fixes address:
- ✅ "Speech recognition error: no-speech" - Now handled silently
- ✅ Automatic restart in voice mode - Implemented with safeguards
- ✅ Extension context invalidation - Protected with try-catch blocks
- ✅ User-friendly error messages for real issues

## Next Steps

These fixes improve the existing audio-chat.tsx component. The next phase will be to implement the new modular voice components (Task 1) which will provide even better error handling and user experience.
