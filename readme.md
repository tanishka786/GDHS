# 🦴 Orthopedic Assistant MCP (OrthoAssist)

## 📌 Overview
**OrthoAssist** is an **MCP-based platform** where X-rays meet artificial intelligence to transform orthopedic care.  
It enables doctors, health workers, and patients to **analyze musculoskeletal X-rays in real-time**, detect fractures, classify their severity, and generate **easy-to-understand medical reports** within minutes.

By combining **YOLO-based fracture detection** with a **Groq-powered LLM for natural language reporting**, OrthoAssist reduces diagnosis time from **hours to just minutes**, making orthopedic expertise **accessible anytime, anywhere** — even in rural and under-resourced areas.
